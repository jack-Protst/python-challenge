# python-challenge
For my code I used chatgpt to help me when I had problems with my process. For PyBank, I intially had the variable "changes" as a number and coudln't recorded the total changes, chatgpt help me by suggesting I use a list instead and that way I could find the average change by using sum through the list and dividing it by its length. For PyPoll I couldn't get past the first vote using "csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=",")" and chatGPT helped me fix that using DictReader.
